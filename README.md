# Oh-my-decimal tests

Additional tests for [Oh-my-decimal](https://github.com/LiarPrincess/Oh-my-decimal) - IEEE 754 decimal floating point implemented in Swift.

Those tests are generated using Python `decimal` module, which means that they are very low quality. Some Swift specific behavior is backed in, so do not use them as a generic IEEE 754 test suite.

Run `python3 src` to generate files.

You can also extract the `output.7z` archive.
